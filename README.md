# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio consists of a host of data science projects ranging from ANNs using PyTorch and decision trees in Matlab. The majority of these projects were for academic purposes and are thus accompanied with reports thoroughly analysing results.


## Contents

* __Exploring Q-Learning__: Implementation of the Q-Learning Algorithm in a suite of different environments ranging from basic to advanced. Results included the successful finding of optimal policies across all environments. \
*Topics: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, Double Deep Q-Learning, Dueling Deep Q-Learning* 

* __Classifying the Higgs Signal__: A comparative study of decision trees and logistic regression to classify the Higgs Boson particle. Results showed that the decision tree performed better - with a reduced threshold of 0.4. \
*Topics: Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation* 

* __Handwritten Digit Classification__: A comparative study of the multilayer perceptron and support vector machines to classify handwritten digits. Results showed slightly improved performance for the SVM. \
*Topics: Supervised Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines, Model Evaluation* 

* __Predicting EPS and its key factors__: Investigating factors influencing earnings per share (EPS) and buiding a random forest to predict EPS. \
*Topics: Supervised Learning, Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation, Ensemble Methods, Random Forests, Model Evaluation* 

* __Prediction Student Attrition__: Predicting student attrition using ensemble methods (Boosting methods) \
*Topics: Supervised Learning, Data Wrangling, Statistical Testing, Chi-Squared Testing, Ensemble Methods, Boosting Classifiers* 

*Tools: Python, Matlab, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
