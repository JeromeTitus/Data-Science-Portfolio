# Handwritten Digit Classification

This project compares the multilayer perceptron and support vector machines in the handwritten digit classification task. In the training notebooks, a basic overview of each model is provided. The approach is iterative, with basic models built, and improvements made based on initial results. A report of the project is also provided - with results being thoroughly analysed and compared.
